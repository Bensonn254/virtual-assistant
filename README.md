# Benard — Virtual Assistant Portfolio

A highly professional, ultra-fast, and minimalist single-page portfolio website designed for a Virtual Assistant. This site perfectly balances aesthetics (frosted glassmorphism, fluid typography, subtle animations) with flawless performance and an accessible user experience structure.

## Features
- **Responsive Architecture**: Fully responsive grid setup with specialized fallbacks for tricky mobile and tablet viewport rendering (like Android Desktop forcing).
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Uses `-webkit-backdrop-filter` to generate an elegant frosted glass header that responds natively to page scrolling.
- **Scroll Reveal Animations**: Elegant and lightweight JS intersection observers smoothly animate sections into view as the user traverses the page.
- **Automated Year Timestamp**: A vanilla javascript snippet auto-updates the copyright year so the footprint never ages out.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover state lifting (on buttons and cards) and high-contrast scaling on case studies create a premium and engaging tactile feel.
- **Icon Ecosystem**: Uses lightweight inline SVGs from reputable CDNs (compiled locally to prevent layout shifting and ad-blockers failures).
- **High Performance**: 100% vanilla `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. No bloated libraries, no React bundles resulting in near instant Time to Interactive (TTI).

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom Properties/Variables, Flexbox, CSS Grid)
